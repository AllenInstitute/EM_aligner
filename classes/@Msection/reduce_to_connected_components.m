function [L_vec,a] = reduce_to_connected_components(obj, mintiles)
% obj can be a collection of tiles that are not in one section (i.e. with or without same z-value).
% Outputs an array of Msection objects (also not necessarily limited to one
% z-value) that are contiguous (connected -- in 2 or 3 dimensions) by point-matches in a "graph"
% sense.
% obj is an Msection object that already has a complete pm struct
% The idea is that each connected component can be solved using the matrix
% solver separately. Note: These connected components need to be assembled
% afterwards.
